<p>Based on the belief that a company's roots run deep in its community and sharing is a way of communication, Atomy employees and members participate together in a culture of sharing. Sharing is not only one of the most important corporate cultures at Atomy, it is also a concrete way for us to realize our vision of contributing to the development of a balanced society, of which Atomy is a member. Therefore, we have kept our vow to take part in social contribution activities every year since our foundation. Our goal goes beyond just making a profit as a business; we aim to create a better life for all people in our society.</p>
